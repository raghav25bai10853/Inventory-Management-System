# Problem Statement
Managing a small inventory manually is error-prone and time-consuming, especially when tracking quantities, updating records after sales or additions, and generating alerts for low stock. This simple Python application automates these tasks, reducing the risk of mistakes and delays from manual updates and offering immediate feedback for stock changes and shortages. <br>
# Scope of the project
The project covers basic inventory operations: displaying available products and their counts, adding new products or quantities, selling existing products, and notifying users when stock is low. The scope is limited to console input/output and single-user management, suitable for small-scale usage such as a stationery shop, classroom, or home office supply tracking.​<br>
# Target Users
1.) Small business owners and employees needing to manage a modest product range.<br>
2.) Students, instructors, or office staff tracking limited stock supplies.<br>
3.) Beginners learning programming concepts related to inventory and stock management.<br>
# High-level features
1.) Inventory Display: View all products and their current quantities.<br>
2.) Product Addition: Add new products or increase quantities of existing ones.<br>
3.) Product Sale: Deduct sold quantities, with error handling for insufficient stock.<br>
4.) Low Stock Notification: Alert when any product’s quantity drops to or below five units.<br>
5.) Interactive Menu: Navigate all features through a clear console menu.<br>
