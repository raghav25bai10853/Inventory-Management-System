# Inventory-Management-System
VITyarthi CSE Course Project (Python essentials)
# Overview of the project
This is a simple inventory management system that allows users to manage products and their quantities. Users can view the current inventory, add products or sell products and get alerts when product quantities are low. The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
# Features
1.) Display the current inventory of products and their quantities.<br>
2.) Add new products or update quantities of existing products.<br>
3.) Sell products by reducing their quantities in the inventory.<br>
4.) Alerts when product quantity falls below a threshold (5 units).<br>
5.) Simple menu-driven user interface for ease of use.<br>
# Technologies/Tools used
Language - Python 3<br>
Interface - Command Line Interface (CLI) / Terminal<br>
Libraries - Standard Python libraries<br>
# Steps to Install & Run the Project
1.) Ensure Python is installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).<br>
2.) Save the provided code in a .py file, such as inventory_management.py.<br>
3.) Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.<br>
4.) Run the program using the command: python inventory_management.py.<br>
5.) Follow the on-screen menu prompts to operate the system.<br>
# Instructions for testing
1.) Run the program and select option 1 to display the initial inventory.<br>
2.) Use option 2 to add products or quantities; verify the inventory updates accordingly.<br>
3.) Use option 3 to sell products and ensure that stock decreases and low-quantity alert messages appear when quantities fall below 5.<br>
4.) Try selling more than available quantity to test error handling.<br>
5.) Use option 4 to exit the system.<br>
